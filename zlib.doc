\begin{abstract}
The library \pllib{zlib} provides a binding to the
\url[zlib]{http://www.zlib.net/} general purpose compression library.
The prolog library aims as seamlessly reading and writing files
compatible to the \program{gzip} program as well as compressed (network)
communication.

\section{Zlib}

Zlib is a widespread library implementing the RFC1950 (zlib wrapper),
RFC1951 (deflate stream) and 1952 (gzip wrapper) compression standards. 
The SWI-Prolog binding is a foreign library that adds a wrapper to the
low-level I/O of a Prolog stream.  Implemented this way, it can perform
a wide variety of tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Read/write gzip compatible files
    \item Setup standard compressed stream communication
    \item Realise in-memory compression or decompression
    \item Deal with streams holding embedded compressed objects
\end{itemize}

The core predicate of the library is zset_stream/2. The remainder of the
functionality of \pllib{zlib} is defined in Prolog.

\section{Predicate reference}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{zset_stream}{2}{+Stream, +Options}
Enable a stream for compressed I/O.  If an input stream is enabled, it
recognises a gzip or deflate header, inflate the data on subsequent read
and restore the old status of the stream after reading the end of the
compressed input.  Streams can be switched to compressed mode at any
time.

If an output stream is enabled, \arg{Options} define the desired 
wrapper and compression level.  Defined options are:

    \begin{description}
	\termitem{format}{+Format}
Either \const{deflate} (default) or \const{gzip}. The \const{deflate}
envelope is simple and short and is typically used for compressed
(network) communication.  The \const{gzip} envelope is compatible to
the \program{gzip} program and intended to read/write compressed files.
	
	\termitem{level}{+Level}
Number between 0 and 9, specifying the compression level, Higher levels
use more resources. Default is 6, generally believed to be a good
compromise between speed, memory requirement and compression.
    \end{description}

\section{Installation}

\subsection{Unix systems}

Installation on Unix system uses the commonly found {\em configure},
{\em make} and {\em make install} sequence. SWI-Prolog should be
installed before building this package. If SWI-Prolog is not installed
as \program{pl}, the environment variable \env{PL} must be set to the
name of the SWI-Prolog executable. Installation is now accomplished
using:

\begin{code}
% ./configure
% make
% make install
\end{code}

This installs the foreign libraries in \file{$PLBASE/lib/$PLARCH} and
the Prolog library files in \file{$PLBASE/library}, where
\file{$PLBASE} refers to the SWI-Prolog `home-directory'.
